          <p>
            Web applications are getting more and more complex. Many
            organisations are struggling to maintain monolithic frontend
            codebases, and to scale their frontend development processes across
            multiple teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Micro frontends</strong> are just one approach to managing
            that complexity, by splitting products up into smaller, simpler
            applications that can be delivered all the way to production by
            independent, autonomous teams.

            several different implementation approaches, and pitfalls to look
            out for. It also includes a detailed explanation of a live demo
            website built using micro frontends.
